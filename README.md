# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Kickstarter Project


### Purpose
The purpose of the kickstarter project is to help Louise identify what goal she should set her play at in order for it to have the best chance at succeeding. We have access to thousands of kickstarters that range from all types of categories	and subcategories and have the information of their goals and what was actually pledged.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Due to the very comprehensive material on the modules, i did not encounter too many challenges. However, the few I did encounter revolved around the formulas in the data set. More specifically during the second dileverable i had a dificult time filling up column B because I kept doing the the formula wrong and i didn't understand why. After many attempts i realized that the greater than and equal symbols were not in the quotation marks and that kept causing the errors.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The first conclusion i can draw from the Outcomes based on launch dates is that the optimal time to launch a kick starter campaign is in May, this month had the largest successful campaigns compares to the amount that failed. The months that follow such as June and july are also some of the best months because the spread is greater between the successful and the failed campaigns. 
-The second conclusion i can draw from the chart is that December and October are the worst months to launch a kickstarter. THe spread is not big and in fact the spread in December is almost none existant.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- We can conclude that kickstarters whose goals land between 20,000 and 35,000 have an over 50% chance of failing.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The limitations of this data set revolve around the fields that it is centered around, if someone were looking for time they wouldnt be able to get that off this dataset, looking at this you can only see plays in the theater category but if you want musicals this is beyond
scope its limited to plays not beyond that unless you create new dataset.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
You can also create a pie chart to see what percent of the kickstarters make up a certain category. Another great chart would be a stacked bar graph to be able to see the changes within the categories by the subcategories.
